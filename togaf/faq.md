## Which one of the following describes classification methods for architecture and solution artifacts within the Architecture Repository?

Enterprise Continuum

> "The Enterprise Continuum classifies contextual assets used to develop architectures, such as policies, standards, strategic initiatives, organizational structures, and enterprise-level capabilities. The Enterprise Continuum can also classify solutions (as opposed to descriptions or specifications of solutions). Finally, the Enterprise Continuum contains two specializations, namely the Architecture and Solutions Continua."

## Complete the sentence. To promote effective architectural activity within the enterprise, TOGAF 9 recommends the establishment of a(n) _____

Enterprise Architecture Capability

> <https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/chap02.html>

## According to TOGAF, the recommended dimensions used to define the scope of an architecture include all the following, except

A. Architecture Domains
B. Enterprise Focus

<details>
<summary>show me</summary>
answer is D.

Four dimensions are typically used in order to define and limit the scope of an architecture:

- **Breadth** - what is the full extent of the enterprise (i.e., Enterprise Focus)
- **Depth** - To what level of detail should the architecting effort go (i.e., Level of detail)
- **Time Period** - what is the time period that needs to be articulated for the Architecture Vision
- **Architecture Domains**: a complete Enterprise Architecture description should contain all four architecture domains (business, data, application, technology).

>
> As with any business capability, the establishment of an Enterprise Architecture Capability can be supported by the `TOGAF Architecture Development Method (ADM)`. Successful use of the ADM will provide a customer-focused, value-adding, and sustainable architecture practice that enables the business, helps maximize the value of investments, and pro-actively identifies opportunities to gain business benefits and manage risk.
>
> Establishing a sustainable architecture practice within an organization can be achieved by adhering to the same approach that is used to establish any other capability - such as a Business Process Management (BPM) capability - within an organization.
>
> The ADM is an ideal method to be used to architect and govern the implementation of such a capability.
>
> Applying the ADM with the specific Architecture Vision to establish an architecture practice within the organization would achieve this objective.
