## Which one of the following describes classification methods for architecture and solution artifacts within the Architecture Repository?

Enterprise Continuum

> "The Enterprise Continuum classifies contextual assets used to develop architectures, such as policies, standards, strategic initiatives, organizational structures, and enterprise-level capabilities. The Enterprise Continuum can also classify solutions (as opposed to descriptions or specifications of solutions). Finally, the Enterprise Continuum contains two specializations, namely the Architecture and Solutions Continua."

## Complete the sentence. To promote effective architectural activity within the enterprise, TOGAF 9 recommends the establishment of a(n) _____

Enterprise Architecture Capability

> <https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/chap02.html>
Section 2.8 Establishing and Maintaining an Enterprise Architecture Capability - In order to carry out architectural activity effectively within an enterprise, it is necessary to put in place an appropriate business capability for architecture, through organization structures, roles, responsibilities, skills, and processes.

## Which phase of the ADM is used to finalize a set of transition architectures that will support implementation?

## According to TOGAF, the recommended dimensions used to define the scope of an architecture include all the following, except

A. Architecture Domains
B. Enterprise Focus
C. Level of Detail
D. Subject Matter
E. Time Period

<details>
<summary>show me</summary>
answer is D.

Four dimensions are typically used in order to define and limit the scope of an architecture:

- **Breadth** - what is the full extent of the enterprise (i.e., Enterprise Focus)
- **Depth** - To what level of detail should the architecting effort go (i.e., Level of detail)
- **Time Period** - what is the time period that needs to be articulated for the Architecture Vision
- **Architecture Domains**: a complete Enterprise Architecture description should contain all four architecture domains (business, data, application, technology).

Successful use of the ADM will provide a customer-focused, value-adding, and sustainable architecture practice that enables the business, helps maximize the value of investments, and pro-actively identifies opportunities to gain business benefits and manage risk.

**Ensuring the compliance of individual projects with the Enterprise Architecture is an essential aspect of Architecture Governance** (see 44. Architecture Governance). To this end, the IT governance function within an enterprise will normally define two complementary processes:

The **Architecture function** will be required to prepare a series of Project Architectures; i.e., project-specific views of the Enterprise Architecture that illustrate how the Enterprise Architecture impacts on the major projects within the organization (see ADM Phases A to F).

The **IT Governance function** will define a formal Architecture Compliance review process (see 42.3 Architecture Compliance Reviews) for reviewing the compliance of projects to the Enterprise Architecture.

</details>

## Which one of the following describes a purpose of an Architecture Compliance review?

- A. To define the capabilities of the organization
- B. To communicate the technical readiness of the project
- C. To evaluate the readiness of the organization to undergo change
- D. To produce a new Request for Architecture Work

An Architecture Compliance review is a scrutiny of the compliance of a specific project against established architectural criteria, spirit, and business objectives. A formal process for such reviews normally forms the core of an Enterprise Architecture Compliance strategy.

Usually is performed via various Architecture Compliance Review Checklists.
